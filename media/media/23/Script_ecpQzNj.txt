Problem Domain:
==============
Moh: 	As we all know one of the toughest and most gruesome things is to look for a job.
	That's why we made it our mission to make it easier.
	We created a program where you can get jobs from multiple sites at once.
	To do that we selected a few websites to get the data from which are:
	Gulf talent, linkedin, bayt, naukrigulf, and google jobs.
	Using our program you will be able to save time and effort when looking for jobs and make
	this process more accessible
